# Note Taker App

This project utilizes JavaScript, Express JS, Node JS, and is deployed on Heroku. I learned how to develop this application while utilizing these tools. The application provides a "note title" input and "note" input to create tabbed notes saved to the left side of the screen. The user can delete notes as well.
